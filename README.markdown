## Key Features

Coming soon

## Installation

Puzzlenode is a Ruby on Rails 3 application which runs on Ruby 1.9.2 and
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org) databases. Other databases like MySQL
or SQLite are not officially supported.

### Setting Up a Development Copy: Step by Step

To install a development version of Puzzlenode, follow these steps:

1. Fork our GitHub repository: <http://github.com/rmu/puzzlenode>
2. Clone the fork to your computer
3. Run `bundle install` to install all of the dependencies
4. Create a `database.yml` file in `config`. The `config` directory contains
   an example `database.yml` for PostgreSQL.
5. Create an `omniauth.yml` file in `config`. The `config` directory contains
   an example `omniauth.yml` file.
6. Create a `config/initializers/secret_token.rb` file. The
   `config/initializers` directory contains an example `secret_token.rb` file
   with instructions for generating a secret token.
7. Create and initialize the database:

```bash
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:schema:load
```

Finally, run the test suite to make sure everything is working correctly:

```bash
$ rake test
```
